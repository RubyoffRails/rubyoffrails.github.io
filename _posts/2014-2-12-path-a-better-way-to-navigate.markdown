The old busted way: 3 different courses. Confusing, with overlapping content and some
videos that I didn't think students should focus on.

The new way: one path to rule them all. A direction to follow built on the
feedback of a hundred students: one glorious Path. Instead of left-to-right and
up-to-down, students can now feel safe in moving in a top-down manner, without
getting confused at Video numbers.

Over the last 2 years, students have descended on a cluster of videos and
assignments, leaving some to starve. When you look at the starving, videos, cold
and alone, you realize they aren't working as well as they should be. I'm 
partitioning out those content so students can focus on a streamlined
experience, and I'll beginning replacing those videos with new ones.

And so, a cycle will be created; content which phases out will be open sourced,
and new videos created. Huzzah!
